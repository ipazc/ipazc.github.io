I’m a technology enthusiast who has been fascinated by computers since I first started programming in Basic on an Amstrad CPC 6128 back in 1996. This curiosity led me to formally study computer science at the University of León (Spain), where I earned my bachelor's degree in 2015, followed by a master's degree in computer engineering in 2017. In 2023, I completed my Ph.D. in production engineering and computing, focusing on applying artificial intelligence to optimize energy consumption and production management.

During my Ph.D., I worked on developing AI methods like custom neural networks and techniques for analyzing time-series energy data. The goal was to find practical solutions for challenges like data imputation, anomaly detection, and classification—things that could have a real impact on how we use and manage energy.

Since 2014, I've been fortunate enough to work in different roles across both public research and the private sector. My journey began at the National Institute of Cybersecurity, and I later transitioned into the private sector with SMARKIA Energy SL, where I currently serve as Chief AI Officer (CAIO). In this role, I have the privilege of leading AI-driven initiatives that aim to create practical solutions for energy management, combining my passion for technology with real-world impact.

I’m most comfortable working with Python and its ecosystem of tools like Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn. I also have experience with server administration in Linux environments, especially Debian and Ubuntu, and I enjoy exploring the capabilities of Microsoft Azure’s cloud services for deploying scalable solutions.

Outside of work, I’ve been involved in research, publishing a few articles in scientific journals, and I’ve had the chance to participate in Hackathons and present at conferences around the world. I also developed a Python package called [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) for face detection, which has received some positive feedback from the open-source community.

At the end of the day, I consider myself a lifelong learner who’s always eager to take on new challenges, whether it's through research, coding, or just experimenting with new technologies.
