I’m a PhD-level Artificial Intelligence specialist focused on **designing and deploying applied AI systems that actually work in production**.

My work sits at the intersection of **Large Language Models, applied machine learning, and AI system architecture**. Over the past years, I’ve led and implemented AI solutions across both industry and research, ranging from **energy analytics and predictive maintenance** to **LLM-based assistants, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and agent-based workflows**.

I’m currently the **Founder and CEO of RelevAI**, where I help organizations design, build, and deploy AI-powered solutions tailored to real business needs. Previously, I served as **Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer at SMARKIA Energy**, leading enterprise-wide AI strategy and execution within a large-scale SaaS environment.

My background includes an **industrial Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence**, developed in close collaboration with industry, where I focused on time series analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and scalable AI pipelines for energy systems. This experience shaped a strong research-to-production mindset that continues to guide my work today.

Technically, I work primarily with **Python** and modern AI stacks, including machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and LLM-based architectures. I have hands-on experience designing **end-to-end AI systems**, from data processing and model development to deployment, monitoring, and integration into existing platforms.

Beyond client work, I remain active in research, with publications in international journals and conferences, and I enjoy contributing to open-source and technical communities. I approach my work with a strong focus on clarity, maintainability, and real-world impact.

I consider myself a **pragmatic technologist**: research-driven when needed, product-oriented by default, and always curious about how emerging AI capabilities can be turned into robust, usable systems.
