I consider myself a passionate individual about technology and computer science, embarking on my journey as a self-taught programmer back in 1996 with Basic on an Amstrad CPC 6128. My formal studies in the field of computer science commenced at the University of León, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2015. I continued with an official master's degree in computer engineering in 2017 and culminated my academic journey with a Ph.D. in production engineering and computing with a focus on artificial intelligence in 2023.

My doctoral thesis was centered around the application of artificial intelligence to optimize energy consumption and production management, standing out for the development of innovative machine learning and deep learning methods. My research involved creating custom artificial neural networks and advanced techniques for analyzing time series energy data, enabling absence imputation, granularity reconstruction, anomaly detection, and data classification.

I have been working in computer-related positions since 2014, transitioning from roles in public research at the National Institute of Cybersecurity to the private sector at SMARKIA Energy SL. The past 8 years have been particularly significant, as I specialized in a data science and machine learning engineering role. This has allowed me to gain profound expertise in the realms of computer science and artificial intelligence. I'm a passionate autodidact with experience in a wide range of programming languages, with a high degree of specialization in Python, including advanced proficiency in frameworks such as Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. My skills also extend to server administration, especially in Linux environments like Debian and Ubuntu, and I have a strong interest in Microsoft Azure cloud services, where I feel comfortable with offerings such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Container Apps for deploying auto-scalable services.

My dedication to research is evident through my publications in renowned scientific journals, where I have made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. In addition to my research, I have actively participated in various Hackathons, achieving first and second place awards in two of them, and have presented at conferences around the world. I have also created the successful Python package [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) for face detection, which has garnered over 2,000 stars on GitHub.
